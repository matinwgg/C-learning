# C-learning
This repository contains a collection of C programs that I have written. The programs are organized into the following categories:

# Prerequisites
To compile and run C programs, ensure that you the following installed on your local machine:
C compiler (eg. clang, gcc, or cc) and a code edition.

# Description
  1. Basics: This category contains programs that demonstrate the basic concepts of C programming, such as variables, data types, functions, and loops.
  2. Data Structures: This category contains programs that demonstrate the use of various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and trees.

 3. Algorithms: This category contains programs that implement various algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

  4. Games: This category contains programs that implement various games, such as tic-tac-toe, hangman, and pong.
  I hope that this repository will be a useful resource for anyone who is learning C programming.
